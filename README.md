# Camera Color for Yeelight

The objetive of this Android app is to simulate the Philips Hue Ambilight/Syncbox with Yeelight RGB bulbs, the app uses the device camera to determine the dominant color and change the Yeelight color with a telnet connection to its IP Address.

I recommend to buy a wall mount support for the phone and point the device camera to the television with this app on, it will determine the main color on the TV and send it to the Yeelight bulb IP address you put on the app.

This app was made in less than a day so don't expect a beautiful code and I am rathering to work as a web developer right now. I also don't want to put this app on the Play Store, you can compile it with Android Studio.

## Thanks to

* [CameraView](https://github.com/natario1/CameraView/) - amazing library, I used it as the camera on the app.
* [Android-Telnet-Client](https://github.com/hkdsun/Android-Telnet-Client) - base code to the Telnet Client used on this app.
